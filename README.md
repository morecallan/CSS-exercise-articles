# NSS Exercise: CSS Styling Using Nth Child

### Description:
> For each article on your blog page, you need to have the following things to be unique.  

* A different background color.
* A different font family.
* A different font size.
* A different font color.
* A different line height.
* A different padding value.
* Each should have a border, but with rounded corners of different size (e.g. one article could have barely rounded borders, but the next one could be almost circular in shape)

### Final Result:
> Obviously not a fabulous blog look, but it fulfills the requirements.
